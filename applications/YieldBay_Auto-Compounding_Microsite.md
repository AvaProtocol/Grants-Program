# OAK Network Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** YieldBay Auto-Compounding Microsite
* **Team Name:** YieldBay
* **Payment Address:** 69eATnT5aWwv3jKn8Tqvjn1gomiHCSTzC4pJedrtnXMY3Wi6 (TUR)
* **[Level](https://github.com/OAK-Foundation/Grants-Program#levels):** 2

## Project Overview

### Overview

We’ll build a UI to seamlessly set up auto-compounding MangataX liquidity positions powered  by OAK Network’s automation. We propose to build it as an open-source yieldbay micro-site.

MangataX users will be able to manage liquidity positions on MangataX with a flow for setting up auto-compounding on those positions with the desired parameters - reward percentage to compound, the interval between compounding, and task expiry. 

### Ecosystem Fit

This will probably be the first time in Polkadot where XCM is used for anything other than token transfers, a true realisation of the Polkadot promise. Coupling the auto-compounding opportunity with MangataX, we believe that MangataX can initiate a DeFi revolution in the Dotsama ecosystem. 

We realise that a flexible and user-centric UX is necessary to make mass adoption possible.

### Team's experience

Our team has previously built:

* YieldScan, a staking interface for the Polkadot and Kusama blockchains which received 2 grants from the Web3 Foundation and moved $100M+ in cumulative staking volume since launch.

* YieldBay, a yield farm aggregator for dotsama, which also received a grant from Polkadot’s on-chain treasury.

* ChurroFi (deprecated), a staking interface on the CELO blockchain which received a grant from CELO Foundation.

## Development Status 

The project will start development once the grant is approved, as discussed with The Foundation.

## Development Roadmap 

| Number  | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | Liquidity Deposits  | Provide users with a simple UI to provide liquidity to the pool of their choice, similar to [Mangata X](https://app.mangata.finance/).|
| 2  | Auto-compounding  | Users to be able to enable/disable auto-compounding to the pool(s) of their choice, with customisable:<ol><li> Percentage of claimed reward </li> <li> Frequency of Auto-Compounding</li> </ol> For first-time users, it would also prompt them to set up a 1-click compounding task on the Turing network.|
| 3 | Yield Monitoring Dashboard | An easy-to-read dashboard allowing users to track: <ol> <li>Their positions across Mangata X </li> <li> Auto-compounding settings on each position </li> <li>Expected APR based on current market conditions</li> <li> Base APR data sourced from YieldBay’s API </li> <li>ROI calculator allowing users to simulate their earnings</li></ol> |
| 4 | Backend Service | Indexer and API for user’s positions and tokens on MangataX and active auto-compounding tasks. |
| 5 | XCM Working Documentation | An open source, well-documented repository of the XCM working of the auto-compounding feature to reduce information asymmetry. |
